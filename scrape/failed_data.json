                    "Under Dr. Saltz’s direction, the Center for Comprehensive Informatics (CCI) was established in 2008. CCI is dedicated to facilitating multidisciplinary projects in informatics related to integrative research, and to the recruitment to Emory of talented faculty and postdoctoral researchers. The CCI has fostered the development of multiple  collaborative research projects that span Emory, Georgia Tech, Morehouse School of Medicine and Kaiser Permanente. These projects leverage the strong  research groups across Emory to catalyze development of novel interdisciplinary efforts. CCI collaborative efforts cover a  range of fields including large scale data management and processing, techniques and tools for analyzing electronic health records, natural language processing, machine learning, high performance computing, imaging informatics, security, systems for semantic queries on spatial and temporal data, and data integrity in federated databases. These techniques and tools provide enabling translational research informatics technologies forbiomedical researchers to efficiently integrate and mine data obtained from multiple biological scales anddimensions and from multiple data sources.  This expertise has enabled the funding number of high profile strategic program grants including the newEmory Molecular Interaction Center for Functional Genomics,  the ARRA funded Minority Health Grid project and the NCI funded in Silico Center."

                    "I interned on the Research team at Brave during Summer of 2020 under Matteo Varvello, Andrius Aunicas, and Ben Livshits. We developed a prototype for a client-side Web data-saver with the goal of increased user security and privacy. Existing approaches to save users data while browsing are limited to plain HTTP proxy, or MITM proxy approaches. These approaches either have limited reach, expose personalized page contents to third parties, or introduce additional security vulnerabilities to end-users. Instead, we optimized pages at the client through creative usage of HTTP requests, without the aid of middleboxes or past knowledge of the webpage content. Our efforts were focused on optimization of images, which make up over 44% of data costs on the median mobile webpage."

There I worked on the Netalyzr project under Christian Kreibich, and jointly collaborated with researchers at TUM and IMDEA. Our goal was to modernize the ICSI Netalyzr, a Java Applet based network-edge measurement tool, into JavaScript. In doing so we surveyed just what Web measurements can be done given the restrictiveness of the network stacks/security models of modern browsers. We also tackled how one might use third party JavaScript measurements within advertisement networks in order to eliminate the convenience bias associated with conventional crowd-sourced Web measurements."

I also worked on investigating techniques that exploit potential parallelism hidden in multi-threaded applications on CMP systems. In the past, I looked into transactional memory as well as data-centric synchronization approaches to explore potential thread-level parallelism in modern workloads."

Our mission is to conduct research in Artificial Intelligence to help solve the most difficult social problems facing our world.  When we consider what problems to tackle, we focus our efforts on low resource communities both here in the United States and globally.  We draw inspiration from the Grand Challenges of Social Work, the Grand Challenges of Engineering, and the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Together, they outline a set of goals which if attained would greatly benefit the well-being of countless persons across the world.  Simultaneously, these set of goals provide important new directions for AI research. Based on these goals, our initial projects focus on ending homelessness, fighting substance abuse, preventing suicide,  improving access to health care, social responses to global climate change, reducing gang violence, and protecting wildlife."

                    "In 2006, our work culminated in the conception of the world’s first grid-tied microinverter with revolutionized architecture: a photovoltaic (PV) panel level DC-to-AC inverter. From conception to implementation, the AC PV-Module was designed and commercialized with capabilities to inject power back into the grid to improve its quality. The unique design increased the energy harnessed by PV module, resulting in more powerful, more efficient, and more compact single-phase and three-phase micro-inverters. The system increased solar PV system reliability, improved safety, and reduced the balance of system costs. Petra Systems (originally known as Petra Solar) was the first US company to commercialize integrated PV Micro-inverter (AC Module) from academic research team. Today. Petra Systems designs and manufactures the first smart-grid interactive microinverter-based solar power system for installation on utility distribution poles. See www.petrasystems.com."

I work on advanced numeric simulations that derive a building’s daylighting behavior, thermal performance, and material properties. I develop novel approaches for simulating, manipulating, and physically realizing sustainable designs in all phases of a building’s lifecycle. This research directly impacts smart-building design, early-stage design, and retrofitting buildings. I also work on high dimensional light transport problems, such as complex illumination, material appearance, physically-based simulation, and spectral rendering, which facilitate a unique approach to provide both more accurate simulations and efficient algorithms for simulating sustainable architecture and smart buildings."

Together, logic and memory form a co-processor for the host processor. In my PhD thesis, I used the IMA as an off-load engine with an automatic compiler algorithm to decide which loops or loop nests should be executed in the memory vs. host. I also looked at IMA as an intelligent prefetching engine, where it observes patterns of accesses to the main memory, learns it, predicts its continuation, and issues prefetches ahead of time. Due to its location, IMA allows sophisticated memory-intensive types of prefetchers."

                    "1) System security and reliability, and design system simulation: Developed an innovative technique which combinations various factors that achieve the overall ability to test and improve the quality of a given consensus algorithm for a Blockchain. This work included developing a time advancing algorithm to simulate a lightweight mining consensus algorithm behavior in the presence of one or more malicious miners. I examined how trust is achieved in a decentralized (distributed) data structure including availability, and reliability of the systems by studying malicious miner delays and slowdown, and Byzantine fault tolerance. The methodology addressed integrity, non-repudiation, and availability using Communication Sequential Processes,  Stochastic Petri Nets, and Queuing Theory Model. I am currently building a methodology to test the consensus algorithms for liveness and safety."

The vulnerabilities for each root website and its active subdomains are recorded for further analysis.  This tool also allows the user to save the collected data (such as IP addresses, all opened, filtered, and closed ports and Subdomains) in its database for reference and further analysis.

I also argue that the choice of how to maintain a view (incrementally or by re-evaluating the view query) should be left to the database optimizer to make, which has knowledge of, and access to, all parameters that may affect this choice. I built the RHODES relational database query optimizer that supports materialized views and their maintenance. A major part of my thesis work concerned experimental validation of incremental algorithms using the AIX DB2 database system on the TPC-D database benchmark."

In particular, I described a framework for updated in F-logic, an object-oriented logic-based query language. This framework allowed, among other things, the specification of hypothetical queries. A hypothetical query asks the database to predict what would happen, if something were true, even though it may not necessarily be true."

Today, ISA continues to act upon these motivations by partnering with local elementary schools, in which high school “mentors” guide 5th and 6th grade “buddies” through their Science Fair project. In addition, Science Alliance organizes the annual Dine With a Scientist event to provide local students an opportunity to speak to Bay Area professors, engineers, and graduate students of diverse expertise and background; it has helped connect over 500 students with researchers in the past three years."

                    "Flipd (flipdclass.com) is a web-based platform that provides the tools needed to take the guesswork out of the flipped classroom. Teachers upload educational videos from YouTube, slice them into segments, fit review items and notes to the segments, and assign them to students to watch before class. When the students watch the assigned videos, they respond to the integrated review items. This response data is presented to the teacher in a comprehensive dashboard, that gives information ranging from the level of understanding of the class as a whole, to the individual student. So the teacher knows exactly what to do in the next class meeting, using precious face time in class on what really matters: mentoring and coaching students on how to assimilate and apply the knowledge they have garnered from the videos."

                    "The Center for Automata Processing (CAP) is dedicated to research, training and education in automata computing, a new and revolutionary approach to computer processing. Founded in 2013 at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, the Center will establish the Commonwealth of Virginia as a leader in non-von-Neumann computing. Its mission is to advance understanding of auotmata architecture, programming environments, and applications while becoming an engine for the education and development of future scientists and engineers in this novel approach to computing. Using Micron's novel Automata Processor processors and programming infrastructure, the Center helps support training and outreach opportunities in automata computing, and helps identify and facilitate potential inter-departmental and inter-institutional research and education collaborations.  The Center will identify other institutions as potential members that will enrich the intellectual environment surrounding automata computing and support technology transition into industrial practice.  The Center also helps automata researchers identify and apply for research funding.  The research and education will provide new ways to analyze and manage “big data” in fields of social relevance such as bioinformatics, cybersecurity, image analytics and beyond."

                    "I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Oregon State University. My research focuses on testing and understanding critical software systems, especially ways to combine testing, static analysis and machine learning to come up with better tools and techniques for developers and analysts. I have been using static code analysis to examine real world software projects to show that projects suffer from a large number of design issues that get worse over time. Adding more developers or resources don’t solve the issue rather makes it worse. Awareness of code smells aids developers in controlling design degradation, and eventually reduces the technical debt of a project. I have also been exploring the effectiveness of randomized testing, and the relationship between testing, runtime verification and model checking, especially how to scale mutation analysis to real world software systems."
