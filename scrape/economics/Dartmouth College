I teach health economics and policy to undergraduates in the economics department and to health professionals in Dartmouth’s hybrid online Master of Health Care Delivery Science program. Since 2016, I have been co-faculty director of the Master of Health Care Delivery Science program. My research focuses on non-medical determinants of health care use, health, and employment.  This work examines how non-clinical factors like education, health insurance coverage, and the design of public insurance programs shape health care, health, and employment. Much of my research focuses on disabled populations and on populations with mental illness or substance use disorders.  The results of this research have been published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of Health Economics, Health Affairs and numerous other peer-reviewed publications.",
