                    "The USC Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society is a joint venture between the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work and the Viterbi School of Engineering.  Our mission is to conduct research in Artificial Intelligence to help solve the most difficult social problems facing our world.  When we consider what problems to tackle, we focus our efforts on low resource communities both here in the United States and globally.  We draw inspiration from the Grand Challenges of Social Work, the Grand Challenges of Engineering, and the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Together, they outline a set of goals which if attained would greatly benefit the well-being of countless persons across the world.  Simultaneously, these set of goals provide important new directions for AI research. Based on these goals, our initial projects focus on ending homelessness, fighting substance abuse, preventing suicide,  improving access to health care, social responses to global climate change, reducing gang violence, and protecting wildlife."

Real world solutions for this problem requires realistic communication modelling, big data analysis for large networks, and application of optimization tools (both centralized and distributed) for achieving networks with desired performance guarantees.
