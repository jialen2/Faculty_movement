In particular, I investigated hardware techniques at various granularity levels to assist in the management of the last-level shared CMP caches, targeting performance throughput and quality of service. I also worked on investigating techniques that exploit potential parallelism hidden in multi-threaded applications on CMP systems. In the past, I looked into transactional memory as well as data-centric synchronization approaches to explore potential thread-level parallelism in modern workloads."

His FlowMap algorithm developed in 1994 presented the first polynomial-time depth-optimal mapping algorithm for look-up table based FPGAs, and is now a cornerstone in all FPGA synthesis systems.  His group subsequently developed a number of highly innovative FPGA synthesis algorithms, such as Boolean matching for complex programmable logic blocks, mapping for multi-objective trade-off, which served as the basis of Aplus Design Automation.   For his contribution to FPGA logic synthesis, Dr. Cong received the 2011 ACM/IEEE Richard Newton Technical Impact Award in EDA, “for pioneering work on technology mapping for FPGA that has made significant impact to the FPGA research community and industry.”"

                    "In 2006, our work culminated in the conception of the world’s first grid-tied microinverter with revolutionized architecture: a photovoltaic (PV) panel level DC-to-AC inverter. From conception to implementation, the AC PV-Module was designed and commercialized with capabilities to inject power back into the grid to improve its quality. The unique design increased the energy harnessed by PV module, resulting in more powerful, more efficient, and more compact single-phase and three-phase micro-inverters. The system increased solar PV system reliability, improved safety, and reduced the balance of system costs. Petra Systems (originally known as Petra Solar) was the first US company to commercialize integrated PV Micro-inverter (AC Module) from academic research team. Today. Petra Systems designs and manufactures the first smart-grid interactive microinverter-based solar power system for installation on utility distribution poles. See www.petrasystems.com."

I work on advanced numeric simulations that derive a building’s daylighting behavior, thermal performance, and material properties. I develop novel approaches for simulating, manipulating, and physically realizing sustainable designs in all phases of a building’s lifecycle. This research directly impacts smart-building design, early-stage design, and retrofitting buildings. I also work on high dimensional light transport problems, such as complex illumination, material appearance, physically-based simulation, and spectral rendering, which facilitate a unique approach to provide both more accurate simulations and efficient algorithms for simulating sustainable architecture and smart buildings."

Together, logic and memory form a co-processor for the host processor. In my PhD thesis, I used the IMA as an off-load engine with an automatic compiler algorithm to decide which loops or loop nests should be executed in the memory vs. host. I also looked at IMA as an intelligent prefetching engine, where it observes patterns of accesses to the main memory, learns it, predicts its continuation, and issues prefetches ahead of time. Due to its location, IMA allows sophisticated memory-intensive types of prefetchers."

I served as an Assistant Teacher for the \"Mod Design 1\", which focuses on teaching kids the basics of Java through modding Minecraft, for the Summer 2015 session. As the assistant teacher, I supported the primary teacher in content delivery, dealt with disciplinary issues, and served as a \"code coach\" during the open-workshop sections of the course. In addition, I developed new content for advanced students who completed the course content before the end of the camp and developed installation and cleanup scripts to help our team setup and maintain the computer labs we taught in."

                    "I am involved in a project entitled “Hyperspectral Image Analysis of Skin Erythema after Radiation Therapy”. This project is aimed to use data from a new hyperspectral imaging technology developed at McMaster University in Canada, and to propose relevant image analysis algorithms that can precisely quantify skin erythema and, objectively correlate this phenomenon with radiation response. Acute skin erythema is a common side effect with patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment. It displays itself as an increase in skin redness and irritation. Erythema has been reported to correlate to individual patient response to radiation and therefore may be useful to guide and modify courses of treatment in a timely manner. Currently, upon visual examination, a qualitative score can be assigned to characterize the severity of erythema, which then may be used for assessing radiation response. As this clinical assessment is not a quantitative measure and in fact is a highly subjective one, this project aims to develop an alternative objective measure to accurately quantify skin erythema."

This work included developing a time advancing algorithm to simulate a lightweight mining consensus algorithm behavior in the presence of one or more malicious miners. I examined how trust is achieved in a decentralized (distributed) data structure including availability, and reliability of the systems by studying malicious miner delays and slowdown, and Byzantine fault tolerance. The methodology addressed integrity, non-repudiation, and availability using Communication Sequential Processes,  Stochastic Petri Nets, and Queuing Theory Model. I am currently building a methodology to test the consensus algorithms for liveness and safety."

The vulnerabilities for each root website and its active subdomains are recorded for further analysis.  This tool also allows the user to save the collected data (such as IP addresses, all opened, filtered, and closed ports and Subdomains) in its database for reference and further analysis.  This work was developed in collaboration with Clemson University, and as part of this work, I participated in the OWASP summit in Tottingham, UK, 2017."

I also argue that the choice of how to maintain a view (incrementally or by re-evaluating the view query) should be left to the database optimizer to make, which has knowledge of, and access to, all parameters that may affect this choice. I built the RHODES relational database query optimizer that supports materialized views and their maintenance. A major part of my thesis work concerned experimental validation of incremental algorithms using the AIX DB2 database system on the TPC-D database benchmark."

This task was challenging because the orders had to appear to the trading system as if they had arrived from a multitude of T4 lines that connect the various firms with PHLX. The testing teams had a lot of control as to which firms they wanted to emulate, the frequency of orders per firm, and the parameters of the orders (sell/busy, market/limit, symbols, and so on)."

The system provided graphical presentations of the history of the navigation and multiple views of the structure of the explored portion of the web. Queries of the visual language GraphLog were used to query and reformat these visualizations."

WINE users test new Big Data ideas in security, OS reliability, mobile computing, machine learning and visual analytics. For example, WINE allowed us to measure the duration of zero-day attacks in the real world, using a method we described in an academic paper at ACM CCS 2012. The current WINE users include both Symantec engineers and researchers in academia."

Teachers upload educational videos from YouTube, slice them into segments, fit review items and notes to the segments, and assign them to students to watch before class. When the students watch the assigned videos, they respond to the integrated review items. This response data is presented to the teacher in a comprehensive dashboard, that gives information ranging from the level of understanding of the class as a whole, to the individual student. So the teacher knows exactly what to do in the next class meeting, using precious face time in class on what really matters: mentoring and coaching students on how to assimilate and apply the knowledge they have garnered from the videos."

Legion supported secure remote job execution and a virtual distributed file system across sites. In other words the basic capabilities of AWS and DropBox all in one. Legion depended though on high speed wide area networks which were widely available at the time in academia, but not in the commercial spaces. For example at UVA we had 155Mb/s wide area connections, the best wide-area BW encountered in the commercial space at that time was 10 Mb/s. In other words, we were too early."

Founded in 2013 at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, the Center will establish the Commonwealth of Virginia as a leader in non-von-Neumann computing. Its mission is to advance understanding of auotmata architecture, programming environments, and applications while becoming an engine for the education and development of future scientists and engineers in this novel approach to computing. Using Micron's novel Automata Processor processors and programming infrastructure, the Center helps support training and outreach opportunities in automata computing, and helps identify and facilitate potential inter-departmental and inter-institutional research and education collaborations.  The Center will identify other institutions as potential members that will enrich the intellectual environment surrounding automata computing and support technology transition into industrial practice.  The Center also helps automata researchers identify and apply for research funding.  The research and education will provide new ways to analyze and manage “big data” in fields of social relevance such as bioinformatics, cybersecurity, image analytics and beyond."

My research focuses on testing and understanding critical software systems, especially ways to combine testing, static analysis and machine learning to come up with better tools and techniques for developers and analysts. I have been using static code analysis to examine real world software projects to show that projects suffer from a large number of design issues that get worse over time. Adding more developers or resources don’t solve the issue rather makes it worse. Awareness of code smells aids developers in controlling design degradation, and eventually reduces the technical debt of a project. I have also been exploring the effectiveness of randomized testing, and the relationship between testing, runtime verification and model checking, especially how to scale mutation analysis to real world software systems."
