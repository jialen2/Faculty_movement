This included rapid expansion of facilities and capacity building to accommodate increasing numbers of students.  When I arrived, there were about 400 students in masters programs; when I left, there were about 800 students in both masters and bachelors programs, and the university was on track to increase this number to 1600 by 2016.  During this same time, I reduced the university's structural deficit as a percentage of total budget by approximately a factor of two."
