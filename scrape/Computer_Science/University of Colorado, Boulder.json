MNS designs and implements novel and practical cyber-physical systems to make physiological sensing (e.g. breathing volume measurement, brainwave signal monitoring, muscle movement recording, and sleep quality monitoring) less intrusive at lower cost. They evaluate their systems on patients in in-hospital environments such as Colorado's Children Hospital and CU School of Medicine to prove the medical meanings and technical advances of their novel devices and technologies. He is actively pushing his research outcomes to practice through technology transfer activities with 10 patents filed and forming startups to commercialize them. In addition, he has been also working on other topics including securing critical cyber-physical systems and providing seamless network connectivity for smart and connected cities."
