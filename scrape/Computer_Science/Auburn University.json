In this project, new job and packets scheduling algorithms are designed and implemented for embedded systems, cluster computing platforms, and wireless networks. The algorithms are aimed at achieving the best tradeoffs between energy conservation and high performance for energy-efficient computing systems. The algorithms are evaluated through extensive experiments based on both synthetic benchmark/traces and real-world applications."
