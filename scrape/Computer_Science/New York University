                    "I worked for Ezra Black of the Fred Jellinek's speech group in 1989-1990. He hired me to produce a dictionary of nouns and he wanted me to enter 1000 words per day, which I initially thought was impossible, but was actually able to do by the end of my stay. I worked for David Johnson from 1991-1992 on a Relational Grammar based parsing system which resulted in a paper (http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P93/P93-1014.pdf). My work there introduced me to several different graph-based (and feature structure based) linguistic theories. This influenced not only by PhD thesis, but some of my recent work constructing the GLARF semantic parser."
