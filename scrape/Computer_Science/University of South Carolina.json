                    "My goal is to advance a scientific and principled understanding of learning-enabled autonomous systems (e.g., rovers, spacecraft landers) informed by careful empirical and theoretical work. My research is driven by a theoretical understanding of machine learning and the mathematics behind statistical learning theory. I am, in particular, interested in transfer and representation learning, with the goal of developing reliable and robust algorithms that enable autonomous agents to learn optimal policies in a way that they can reuse the learned policy to solve similar tasks over varieties of diverse environments. Naturally, I am also interested in connections between computer systems, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Details: https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io/AISys/"
