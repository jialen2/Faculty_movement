In particular we study how to position mobile routers such that they can provide communication coverage for clients, where these clients can be vehicles, robots, or people.  Real world solutions for this problem requires realistic communication modelling, big data analysis for large networks, and application of optimization tools (both centralized and distributed) for achieving networks with desired performance guarantees.  Separately, I have worked in the areas of hybrid model learning, energy harvesting, and have been a part of several NASA projects including Solar Sails and the Mars Exploration Rovers."
