Proved that retiming and re-synthesis is not complete for sequential equivalent circuits, which requests an operation called sweep to do more transformations. 10 years later, it is finally shown by me that retiming and re-synthesis with sweep can complete any sequential equivalent transformation. The result is based on Abardi and Lamport's demonstration that any two general equivalent systems must have a refinement mapping between their states.
