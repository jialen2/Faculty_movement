                "Professor Rowe is recognized for his research in software-only video encoding, decoding, and streaming, Internet webcasting, distributed collaboration, database management systems, and database application development tools. His research group developed the Berkeley Lecture Webcasting System, which today produces over 30 course lecture webcasts and podcasts each week viewed world-wide by over 500,000 people per month. He published extensively and contributed to several open source software systems (e.g., Berkeley MPEG-1 Tools, Postgres, Open Mash, etc.). He received several “Best Paper” awards, and a paper he co-authored in 1986 with Dr. Michael Stonebraker titled “Design of POSTGRES” received the “1996 ACM SIGMOD Test of Time Award” for a paper that had the most impact over the decade after which it first appeared. Stonebraker and Rowe also received the \"2015 SIGMOD Systems Award for fundamental contributions to the design and implementation of modern, object-relational database systems as embodied by the Postgres DBMS.\"",
