                    "In 2006, our work culminated in the conception of the world’s first grid-tied microinverter with revolutionized architecture: a photovoltaic (PV) panel level DC-to-AC inverter. From conception to implementation, the AC PV-Module was designed and commercialized with capabilities to inject power back into the grid to improve its quality. The unique design increased the energy harnessed by PV module, resulting in more powerful, more efficient, and more compact single-phase and three-phase micro-inverters. The system increased solar PV system reliability, improved safety, and reduced the balance of system costs. Petra Systems (originally known as Petra Solar) was the first US company to commercialize integrated PV Micro-inverter (AC Module) from academic research team. Today. Petra Systems designs and manufactures the first smart-grid interactive microinverter-based solar power system for installation on utility distribution poles. See www.petrasystems.com."

I work on advanced numeric simulations that derive a building’s daylighting behavior, thermal performance, and material properties. I develop novel approaches for simulating, manipulating, and physically realizing sustainable designs in all phases of a building’s lifecycle. This research directly impacts smart-building design, early-stage design, and retrofitting buildings. I also work on high dimensional light transport problems, such as complex illumination, material appearance, physically-based simulation, and spectral rendering, which facilitate a unique approach to provide both more accurate simulations and efficient algorithms for simulating sustainable architecture and smart buildings."

Using Java3D and 3D Studio Max, models of the earth and military equipment were created. Specific involvement included designing, coding, and testing the plug-in manager that allows for a remote interface with Java Web Start, Map visualization allowing Builder to use Satellite imagery, and designing a plug-in to allow Java3D to import and render 3D Studio Max models.

Together, logic and memory form a co-processor for the host processor. In my PhD thesis, I used the IMA as an off-load engine with an automatic compiler algorithm to decide which loops or loop nests should be executed in the memory vs. host. I also looked at IMA as an intelligent prefetching engine, where it observes patterns of accesses to the main memory, learns it, predicts its continuation, and issues prefetches ahead of time. Due to its location, IMA allows sophisticated memory-intensive types of prefetchers."
