                "Aplus' success built upon Dr. Cong's pioneer in the field of FPGA synthesis. His FlowMap algorithm developed in 1994 presented the first polynomial-time depth-optimal mapping algorithm for look-up table based FPGAs, and is now a cornerstone in all FPGA synthesis systems.  His group subsequently developed a number of highly innovative FPGA synthesis algorithms, such as Boolean matching for complex programmable logic blocks, mapping for multi-objective trade-off, which served as the basis of Aplus Design Automation.   For his contribution to FPGA logic synthesis, Dr. Cong received the 2011 ACM/IEEE Richard Newton Technical Impact Award in EDA, “for pioneering work on technology mapping for FPGA that has made significant impact to the FPGA research community and industry.”",
