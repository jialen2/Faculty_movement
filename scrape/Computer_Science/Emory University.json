While at MIT, I was a member of the Laboratory for Computational Physiology and Clinical Inference under the direction of Professor George C. Verghese, and a research fellow at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Harvard Medical School, where I held a National Research Service Award (NRSA) under the supervision of Professor Atul Malhotra. I have worked and published on several areas of research, including advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques, computational neuroscience/brain machine interface, physiological control systems, predictive monitoring in intensive care unit, and nonlinear and nonstationary multidimensional time-series analysis in massive temporal biomedical databases; resulting in over 35 peer-reviewed publications."
