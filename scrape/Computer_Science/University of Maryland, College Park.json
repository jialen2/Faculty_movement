WINE aggregates multiple terabyte-size data feeds, collected by Symantec on millions of hosts worldwide, and enables open-ended experiments at scale. WINE users test new Big Data ideas in security, OS reliability, mobile computing, machine learning and visual analytics. For example, WINE allowed us to measure the duration of zero-day attacks in the real world, using a method we described in an academic paper at ACM CCS 2012. The current WINE users include both Symantec engineers and researchers in academia."
