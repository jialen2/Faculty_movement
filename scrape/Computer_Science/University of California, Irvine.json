My research focuses on testing and understanding critical software systems, especially ways to combine testing, static analysis and machine learning to come up with better tools and techniques for developers and analysts. I have been using static code analysis to examine real world software projects to show that projects suffer from a large number of design issues that get worse over time. Adding more developers or resources don’t solve the issue rather makes it worse. Awareness of code smells aids developers in controlling design degradation, and eventually reduces the technical debt of a project. I have also been exploring the effectiveness of randomized testing, and the relationship between testing, runtime verification and model checking, especially how to scale mutation analysis to real world software systems."
