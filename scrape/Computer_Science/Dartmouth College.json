                "Andrew T. Campbell is a professor of computer science at Dartmouth College. His current research on digital health lies at the intersection of mobile computing, machine learning and behavioral health. Andrew develops mobile sensing systems for capturing, learning and interpreting people's surroundings, behaviors and networks (both social and speech networks). His vision is a world where mobile AI can accurately and passively assess a wide variety of challenging illnesses (e.g., depression) using machine learning and predictive analytics with the goal of delivering personalized interventions to keep people healthy.",
                "Andrew is a leader in mobile computing and is well known for his early work on mobile sensing algorithms and systems [1-5].  He “pioneered applying machine learning across local devices and servers”​ (ACM SenSys Test of Time Award​ 2018 citation)​ to first infer human behavior (e.g., in-conversation, sitting, walking) on smartphones-- today every Apple and Android phone and wearable supports activity recognition. Before joining Dartmouth, he was a tenured associate professor of electrical engineering at Columbia University working on wireless networks. Prior to that, he spent ten years in the software industry leading the development of wireless packet networks and operating systems. During 2016-2017, he joined Google to work on cardiovascular health as a member of the Android group. He is currently a visiting research scientist at Verily.",
