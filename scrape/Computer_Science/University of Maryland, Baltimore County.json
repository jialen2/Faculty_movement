                    "In radiation oncology, a prescription for therapeutic radiation must be co-signed by both a board certified physician and a board-certified physicist. In 2009, there was a transition in national policy which required that, in order to become board-certified, a radiation oncology medical physicist would need to first complete an accredited residency program. Johns Hopkins recruited me to be the first resident in their medical physics program in a dual role where I also did research as a postdoctoral fellow. Based on my interest in research leadership, and because so much of the nation's research investment is clinically-focused, I chose this opportunity as an important supplement to my existing research and policy background. While at Hopkins, I gained broad first-hand experience with clinical work, including participation in a range of clinical and computational research projects."

I have been recognized by external sources (e.g. FAA, NASA, Boeing, Inmarsat, Iridium, Eurocontrol) as an expert on interference matters regarding safety-critical CNS radio links.  I'm the recipient of multiple patents and technical awards for innovative application of digital signal processing techniques to antenna, monitoring, and control designs.
