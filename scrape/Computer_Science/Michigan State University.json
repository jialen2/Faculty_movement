Avida is used to study the dynamics of evolution and ecology via self-replicating computer programs. In addition to codebase maintenance, I extended Avida to run as Emscripten transpiled, Javascript-based web worker as part of an initiative to bring a web-based version of Avida into the classroom. My additional contributions include designing the communication protocols to work with the GUI front-end and modifying the backend’s functionalities to work within a web browser. To facilitate debugging, I architected and implemented a web socket-based system to report about and control the application backend as it executes. To assist with quality assurance, I architected and implemented a developer website to store and retrieve debug and diagnostic information from clients. I provided one-on-one support for training students and researchers about the architecture and design details of Avida. I also co-authored the center’s data management plan. C++, Python, and Javascript were the primary languages I used in this position.  This position was based at the BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action at Michigan State University."
