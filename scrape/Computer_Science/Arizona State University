In particular, I investigated hardware techniques at various granularity levels to assist in the management of the last-level shared CMP caches, targeting performance throughput and quality of service. I also worked on investigating techniques that exploit potential parallelism hidden in multi-threaded applications on CMP systems. In the past, I looked into transactional memory as well as data-centric synchronization approaches to explore potential thread-level parallelism in modern workloads."
