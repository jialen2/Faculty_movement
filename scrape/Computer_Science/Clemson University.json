Today, ISA continues to act upon these motivations by partnering with local elementary schools, in which high school “mentors” guide 5th and 6th grade “buddies” through their Science Fair project. In addition, Science Alliance organizes the annual Dine With a Scientist event to provide local students an opportunity to speak to Bay Area professors, engineers, and graduate students of diverse expertise and background; it has helped connect over 500 students with researchers in the past three years."

                    "I was the Animation Camp administrator for Youth Digital. This camp is a summer program that teaches children from ages 6 to 14 the production of animated film. From concept art to animation, rendering and even 3D printing. My job was to make sure the teachers had all the materials they needed and to make sure all the students were getting all the materials they needed as well. I also played a role in each stage of the class/pipeline helping students get an idea of the story they want to tell, teaching techniques in 3d modeling and helping them push their animation to tell their story."
