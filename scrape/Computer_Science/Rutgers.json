Teachers upload educational videos from YouTube, slice them into segments, fit review items and notes to the segments, and assign them to students to watch before class. When the students watch the assigned videos, they respond to the integrated review items. This response data is presented to the teacher in a comprehensive dashboard, that gives information ranging from the level of understanding of the class as a whole, to the individual student. So the teacher knows exactly what to do in the next class meeting, using precious face time in class on what really matters: mentoring and coaching students on how to assimilate and apply the knowledge they have garnered from the videos."
