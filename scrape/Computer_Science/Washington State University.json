We have investigated conditioning the control signals of the DFIG system by determining the system's bandwidth in the dq synchronous reference frame. The advantage of the proposed scheme is to use a low pass conditioning filter instead of the conventionally used band pass filter. The former has the disadvantage of tuning the frequency of the variable speed DFIG system; especially, at the rotor side."
