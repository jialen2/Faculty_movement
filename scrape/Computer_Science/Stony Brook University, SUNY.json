                    "Under Dr. Saltz’s direction, the Center for Comprehensive Informatics (CCI) was established in 2008. CCI is dedicated to facilitating multidisciplinary projects in informatics related to integrative research, and to the recruitment to Emory of talented faculty and postdoctoral researchers. The CCI has fostered the development of multiple  collaborative research projects that span Emory, Georgia Tech, Morehouse School of Medicine and Kaiser Permanente. These projects leverage the strong  research groups across Emory to catalyze development of novel interdisciplinary efforts. CCI collaborative efforts cover a  range of fields including large scale data management and processing, techniques and tools for analyzing electronic health records, natural language processing, machine learning, high performance computing, imaging informatics, security, systems for semantic queries on spatial and temporal data, and data integrity in federated databases. These techniques and tools provide enabling translational research informatics technologies forbiomedical researchers to efficiently integrate and mine data obtained from multiple biological scales anddimensions and from multiple data sources.  This expertise has enabled the funding number of high profile strategic program grants including the newEmory Molecular Interaction Center for Functional Genomics,  the ARRA funded Minority Health Grid project and the NCI funded in Silico Center."

We developed a prototype for a client-side Web data-saver with the goal of increased user security and privacy. Existing approaches to save users data while browsing are limited to plain HTTP proxy, or MITM proxy approaches. These approaches either have limited reach, expose personalized page contents to third parties, or introduce additional security vulnerabilities to end-users. Instead, we optimized pages at the client through creative usage of HTTP requests, without the aid of middleboxes or past knowledge of the webpage content. Our efforts were focused on optimization of images, which make up over 44% of data costs on the median mobile webpage."

There I worked on the Netalyzr project under Christian Kreibich, and jointly collaborated with researchers at TUM and IMDEA. Our goal was to modernize the ICSI Netalyzr, a Java Applet based network-edge measurement tool, into JavaScript. In doing so we surveyed just what Web measurements can be done given the restrictiveness of the network stacks/security models of modern browsers. We also tackled how one might use third party JavaScript measurements within advertisement networks in order to eliminate the convenience bias associated with conventional crowd-sourced Web measurements."
