Together with my colleagues at FAIR, we suggested a new paradigm for VQA by using grid convolution feature maps to encode images instead of relying on bounding boxes whose annotations are tedious and expensive to collect. Our findings are reported in a CVPR 2020 paper."

As a teacher, my strengths were inspiring critical thinking through questioning as well as boiling down complex physics concepts to essential structures.  Like many young teachers, I could improve on my ability to create a structured environment for my students.  Additionally, I wish I could have offered something more to take away from my classroom for the students who were less technically inclined."
