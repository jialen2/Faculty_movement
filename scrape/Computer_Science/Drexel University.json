I also argue that the choice of how to maintain a view (incrementally or by re-evaluating the view query) should be left to the database optimizer to make, which has knowledge of, and access to, all parameters that may affect this choice. I built the RHODES relational database query optimizer that supports materialized views and their maintenance. A major part of my thesis work concerned experimental validation of incremental algorithms using the AIX DB2 database system on the TPC-D database benchmark."

We modified one of the existing web browsers to communicate, as the user browses, the URL, title and anchors of each document fetched. The system provided graphical presentations of the history of the navigation and multiple views of the structure of the explored portion of the web. Queries of the visual language GraphLog were used to query and reformat these visualizations."
