Legion supported secure remote job execution and a virtual distributed file system across sites. In other words the basic capabilities of AWS and DropBox all in one. Legion depended though on high speed wide area networks which were widely available at the time in academia, but not in the commercial spaces. For example at UVA we had 155Mb/s wide area connections, the best wide-area BW encountered in the commercial space at that time was 10 Mb/s. In other words, we were too early."

                    "I began working at SPI as employee number 1 as a junior at UCSD. Over the next three years the company grew from zero revenue to ~$3.5M in revenue, mostly in Europe. Over that time I was responsible for product development for our three principal products: LogiCalc - a spread sheet that was OEM'd as CalcStar, LogiQuest - a full distributed SQL implementation on 64KB machines with transaction support, and OpenAccess II - one of the first integrated database, spreadsheet, and graphics applications.  I was the principal author for LogiQuest. When I left the engineering team had 34 members."

                    "The Center for Automata Processing (CAP) is dedicated to research, training and education in automata computing, a new and revolutionary approach to computer processing. Founded in 2013 at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, the Center will establish the Commonwealth of Virginia as a leader in non-von-Neumann computing. Its mission is to advance understanding of auotmata architecture, programming environments, and applications while becoming an engine for the education and development of future scientists and engineers in this novel approach to computing. Using Micron's novel Automata Processor processors and programming infrastructure, the Center helps support training and outreach opportunities in automata computing, and helps identify and facilitate potential inter-departmental and inter-institutional research and education collaborations.  The Center will identify other institutions as potential members that will enrich the intellectual environment surrounding automata computing and support technology transition into industrial practice.  The Center also helps automata researchers identify and apply for research funding.  The research and education will provide new ways to analyze and manage “big data” in fields of social relevance such as bioinformatics, cybersecurity, image analytics and beyond."
