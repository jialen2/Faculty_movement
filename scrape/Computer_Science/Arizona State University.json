Had to work really hard (even on Christmas eves) to catch up. Learned theory of computing from Professor Oscar Ibarra, and data structures and algorithms from Professor Sartaj Sahni. Used to spend an hour to understand one page of \"Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computing\" by Hopcroft and Ullman. Crashed the 64-node NCUBE numerous times. Finally transformed from a mathematician to a computer scientist."
