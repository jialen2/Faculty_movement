Coordinated the introduction to the Eichenbaum lab of single-photon calcium imaging in freely-moving mice using Inscopix miniaturized fluorescence microscopes.  Created a novel algorithm and software package, TENASPIS, for efficiently extracting neuronal activity from movies recorded with these microscopes, using MATLAB and its image processing toolbox; this package has been widely used by lab colleagues.  Managed and trained an undergraduate student who then became a lab assistant under my supervision, and went on to become a neuroscience Ph.D. student. Performed experiments in freely moving mice to compare the way hippocampal neurons respond to tasks that are either primary spatial or temporal in nature.  Co-author on multiple publications."
