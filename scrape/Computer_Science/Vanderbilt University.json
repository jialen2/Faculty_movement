I gave up my position at Newberry in 1981 to embark on a new career in medical image processing. In 1982 Vanderbilt University hired me as assistant professor of computer science.

Prof. Ndukaife and his team are developing nano-optical tweezers capable of stable trapping of nanometer-scale objects. The conventional optical tweezer technology, which was recently recognized with a 2018 Physics Nobel prize can readily trap microscopic objects but faces challenges with the trapping of nanoscale objects due to the diffraction limit. The nano-optical tweezers being developed by Prof. Ndukaife and his team aims to solve these challenges and enable new applications not previously possible.",

This work advances the historical modeling approaches with bias-dependent and layout-aware methods for modeling the dose-rate and single-event effects in advanced technologies. A novel layout-aware analysis method is developed, utilizing a hybrid of compact models (for efficiency) and spatially-aware layout objects (for geometric charge collection accuracy), in an industry standard integrated circuit design tool flow. The methods developed in this research are being actively utilized in radiation-effects research at universities, aerospace and defense corporations, and commercial integrated circuit design and manufacturing facilities."

The ESB is designed to foster interdisciplinary research, collaboration, and innovation. As a thought leader Dean Fauchet introduced the concept of \"intellectual neighborhoods\" that highlights the School of Engineering’s interdisciplinary research competencies instead of traditional departmental lines. As a successful entrepreneur, he has refocused the research and education missions among faculty and students toward entrepreneurship and innovation by creating makerspaces, outfitting design labs, and encouraging design throughout the curriculum. He also holds numerous patents and founded a successful start-up company.",
