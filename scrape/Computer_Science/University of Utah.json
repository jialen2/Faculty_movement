At the molecular level of description, I was focused on the interactions among monomers along the actin filament, pointing out what specific residues rearrangments and in what particular regions of the actin filament are able to induce changes in the mechanics of the protein. At the microscale, I investigated the changes in mechanical properties of active actin networks as a response to variations of stiffness of the extra-cellular matrix. Always at the microscale, I investigated the mechanisms of formation of different actin assemblies, their morphological and mechanical properties, with emphasis on stress fibers and focal adhesions."

At the university of Chicago, I am developing such a framework."

One promising prospect of this technological advancement is its potential for seamlessly integrating the intelligences of information storing, computing, and transmitting. My research interests and efforts span the areas of fundamental limits and practical designs of (wireless and wireline) caching networks, distributed storage and computing systems, (statistical) signal/data processing, stochastic network optimization, and wire- less communications. I am particularly interested in developing caching, (distributed) information processing and transmitting technologies that significantly improve the performance of current systems. My work covers the entire spectrum of research in this domain: from theoretically studying the fundamental limits to practically developing and implementing low-complexity algorithms, from designing information placements techniques, to advancing information processing and delivery technologies, to developing novel applications, to evaluating these applications through real-world deployment studies."

The architectural professions can use these tools during the design phase of a project. If a potential hazard (steps for example) are analyses as not visible, the designer can change lighting, materials and or geometry to iteratively solve the visibility challenge. The work is a collaboration between University of Minnesota, Utah and Indiana, including specialists in low vision, computational vision, computer and cognitive science, lighting visualization and lighting design."
