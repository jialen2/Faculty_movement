Good performance (e.g., fast response time) is critical for the business of e-commerce web applications like Amazon. High utilization through virtualization and hardware resource sharing is essential for cloud venders for high return on investment. However, both practitioners and researchers have experienced large response time fluctuations or unpredictable performance in cloud, especially when the utilization becomes high. To solve this problem, my research has been focusing on two aspects: first, investigate various system-level factors that cause the performance unpredictability of web applications running at high resource utilization; second, design, implement, and evaluate practical solutions to mitigate the negative impact of those factors and achieve the performance predictability at high resource utilization."
