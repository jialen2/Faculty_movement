                    "Working towards achieving robust human-robot interaction through quantitative modeling of human-robot dialog. My current projects are looking at using contextual information for confirmation of potentially expensive (i.e., risky) tasks in human-robot dialog, creating a ubiquitous human-robot interaction framework for multi-device man-machine interaction (with devices ranging from mobile, humanoid robots, static Kinect-like RGB-D sensors, and Android phones) and using an adaptive control mechanism to safely guide an autonomous wheelchair. The last project mentioned addresses safety issues with navigation specifically for people with neurological or mobility impairments. In all projects, machine vision is intended to be used as the principal sensing modality, particularly for the navigation of intelligent systems, human interface and human action recognition. My current experimental platforms include the Willow Garage PR2 and the TurtleBot robots."
