A large number of developers from those organizations practice code review. In my survey of these developers, the results showed that they spend about 10% of their time on code review. Thus, increasing the effectiveness of peer code review has the potential to have a great impact. Therefore, the goal of my dissertation is to understand and improve contemporary code review practices."
