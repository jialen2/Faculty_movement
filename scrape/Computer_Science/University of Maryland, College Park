WINE users test new Big Data ideas in security, OS reliability, mobile computing, machine learning and visual analytics. For example, WINE allowed us to measure the duration of zero-day attacks in the real world, using a method we described in an academic paper at ACM CCS 2012. The current WINE users include both Symantec engineers and researchers in academia."
