                    "1) System security and reliability, and design system simulation: Developed an innovative technique which combinations various factors that achieve the overall ability to test and improve the quality of a given consensus algorithm for a Blockchain. This work included developing a time advancing algorithm to simulate a lightweight mining consensus algorithm behavior in the presence of one or more malicious miners. I examined how trust is achieved in a decentralized (distributed) data structure including availability, and reliability of the systems by studying malicious miner delays and slowdown, and Byzantine fault tolerance. The methodology addressed integrity, non-repudiation, and availability using Communication Sequential Processes,  Stochastic Petri Nets, and Queuing Theory Model. I am currently building a methodology to test the consensus algorithms for liveness and safety."

The vulnerabilities for each root website and its active subdomains are recorded for further analysis.  This tool also allows the user to save the collected data (such as IP addresses, all opened, filtered, and closed ports and Subdomains) in its database for reference and further analysis.  This work was developed in collaboration with Clemson University, and as part of this work, I participated in the OWASP summit in Tottingham, UK, 2017."
